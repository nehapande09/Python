ABSTRACTION   :
           Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information.
           The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.
           It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs

ENCAPSULATION :
               Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).
               It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
                This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.
                To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method.
                Those types of variables are known as private variable.
                A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.
